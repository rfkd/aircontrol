 * @brief Class to avoid multiple program instances.
 *
 * A lock file will be created. If another program instance is started in
 * parallel (and the lock file exists) the class will block execution until the
 * lock file has been removed (which is done at program exit automatically).
 * This will prevent accessing shared resources by multiple instances.
