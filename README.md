# **aircontrol**

### **FEATURES**

*  Send configurable patterns with manchester or RCO-compatible encoding through a 433,92 MHz transmitter.
* Air scan support in combination with a 433,92 MHz receiver for analyzing data streams. This can replace an oscilloscope if timing and code scheme are already known.
* Configuration file support for easily addressing air targets.


### **INSTALLATION**

aircontrol needs to be compiled on a Raspberry Pi (or on a host with a compatible cross tool chain). The following libraries are needed:

* **WiringPi**, see <http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/>
* **libconfig**, install with: `apt-get install libconfig-dev`

Run the following command to build aircontrol:
> $ make

Complete the installation as root (optional):
> \# make install

The following command removes aircontrol and its configuration file:
> \# make uninstall

Please note that aircontrol needs to be executed as root for accessing the GPIO
hardware.


### **COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS**

Execute `aircontrol -h` to see a quick overview over all available command line parameters. The following parameters are available:

`-c <file>` &nbsp; Configuration file, defaulting to */etc/aircontrol.conf*. This file is mandatory.

`-g <pin>` &nbsp; Override the GPIO pin to be used for scanning and targeting. The parameter must be a Broadcom GPIO number, not re-mapped. Might be used for quickly testing multiple transmitters or receivers.

`-l` &nbsp; Limit the number of aircontrol instances to 1, i.e. prevent multiple program instances.
        
`-s <ms>` &nbsp; Perform an air scan for the given number of milliseconds. An ASCII graph will be written to stdout which can be redirected to a file with `tee` or something similar.
        
`-t <target>` &nbsp; Execute the given air target, i.e. transmit the target code as configured.

Either parameter `-s` or `-t` is mandatory.


### **CONFIGURATION FILE**

The default configuration file is located in */etc/aircontrol.conf*. For details about the configuration file syntax check the manual of libconfig on its project site: <http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html>

The configuration consists of different sections explained below.

#### 'scan' section

This section defines all air scan relevant parameters.

`gpioPin` &nbsp; GPIO pin of the Raspberry Pi which is connected to the DATA line of a 433,92 MHz receiver. This parameter expects Broadcom GPIO numbers, not re-mapped. Example: `gpioPin = 18;`

`samplingRate` &nbsp; Delay between two samples when air scanning in microseconds. This parameter in combination with the `-s` value defines the number of segments being output. For example when scanning for 1ms (=1000us) with a `samplingRate` of 100us there will be 10 segments printed to stdout. Example: `samplingRate = 100;`

#### 'target' section

This section stores configuration defaults for all target sections.

`gpioPin` &nbsp; GPIO pin of the Raspberry Pi which is connected to the DATA line of a 433,92 MHz transmitter. This parameter expects Broadcom GPIO numbers, not re-mapped. Example: `gpioPin = 17;`

`dataLength` &nbsp; Pulse length of a single data element (0 or 1) in microseconds. Example: `dataLength = 1780;`

`syncLength` &nbsp; Pulse length of a single sync element (s or S) in microseconds. Example: `syncLength = 5000;`

`sendCommand` &nbsp; Number of times the air command will be transmitted. Example: `sendCommand = 10;`

`sendDelay` &nbsp; Delay between the air command transmissions in microseconds. Example: `sendDelay = 10000;`

`airCode` &nbsp; Encoding type of the air command. This parameter defines the validity and meaning of all `airCommand` values. The following radio frame encodings are currently supported. Example: `airCode = 0;`

                               _           _               _ 
    0  Manchester; values:  0)  |_    1) _|     s) _    S)
                                             _            ___
    1  Remote Controlled Outlet; values: 0) | |___    1) |   |_
        (for reference: 00 -> 0, 11 -> 1, 01 -> F)
		
	2  Tormatic:    0)  |___    1) | |_| |
	
	3   Wofi:       0)  |____    1) |    |_
    

`airCommand` &nbsp; Sequence of values to be transmitted. The accepted values of this parameter are defined by airCode. Example: `airCode = 0; airCommand = "sss010011SSS";`

        _    __   _    _   ____
    ___| |__|  |_| |__| |_| 
    sss  0  1  0   0  1   1 SSS

#### Actual target sections

The actual target sections can be named freely, they incorporate all defaults from the 'target' section. All parameters from the 'target' section apply. For example all timing relevant parameters can be defined in the 'target' section while the real target sections only contain the appropriate `airCommand`.
